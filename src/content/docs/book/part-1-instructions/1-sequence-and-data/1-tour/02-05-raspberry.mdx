**Title:** Counting Button Presses to Control LED Blink Frequency

**Objective:**  
- Learn the basics of sequential execution by creating a program that counts button presses and controls the LED blink frequency accordingly.

---

**Concepts You Will Explore:**  
- **Sequential Execution**: Understand how programs run instructions in sequence, where one step follows another.
- **Data Types**: Introduction to basic data types like integers to store and manipulate the number of button presses.

---

**Understanding Sequential Execution**:  
In this activity, you will create a program that counts how many times a button is pressed. Based on the number of presses, the program will blink an LED faster or slower. This is an excellent example of sequential execution, where each button press is counted, and the LED responds accordingly.

**C++ Code Example Using SplashKit**:

```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    // Initialize GPIO and pins
    raspi_init();
    pins button_pin = PIN_12;
    pins led_pin = PIN_11;

    // Set pin modes
    raspi_set_mode(button_pin, GPIO_INPUT);
    raspi_set_mode(led_pin, GPIO_OUTPUT);

    int press_count = 0;  // Variable to store button press count
    int delay_time = 1000; // Initial delay for LED blink in ms

    open_window("Button Press Counter", 1, 1);

    while (!any_key_pressed())
    {
        process_events();

        // Check if button is pressed
        if (raspi_read(button_pin) == GPIO_HIGH)
        {
            press_count++;  // Increment button press count
            raspi_write(led_pin, GPIO_HIGH);  // Turn LED on
            delay(delay_time);  // Wait for delay_time milliseconds
            raspi_write(led_pin, GPIO_LOW);   // Turn LED off
            delay(delay_time);  // Wait for delay_time milliseconds

            // Adjust delay time based on press count
            delay_time = 1000 / press_count;  // Decrease delay as presses increase

            // Debounce delay to prevent multiple presses from registering
            delay(300);
        }
    }

    close_all_windows();
    raspi_cleanup();
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of Code**:  
- **raspi_init()**: Initializes the Raspberry Pi for GPIO operations.
- **raspi_read()**: Reads the current state of the button connected to **PIN_12**.
- **press_count**: This variable keeps track of how many times the button is pressed.
- **delay_time**: The time interval for blinking the LED. It decreases as the button is pressed more.
- **Sequential Execution**: Each time the button is pressed, the program counts the press and modifies the blink speed of the LED.

---

**Additional Information**:  
- **Debouncing**: The small delay after a button press ensures that mechanical noise from the button doesnâ€™t cause multiple presses to be registered. 
- **Warning**: If the library does not respond, ensure you run `sudo pigpiod` to start the GPIO daemon.
